need to create a LocationSearch component for users to search and explore locations in Amsterdam, particularly focusing on bike rental locations. Let me analyze what I have and plan my approach.

The images show:

A bike rental website with multiple location listings in Amsterdam
A mobile app interface showing bike rental locations on a map with search functionality
A map of Amsterdam with bike routes marked
Maps showing specific bike routes and points of interest
A map showing a bike rental location with parking information
I'm working with a React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project. Let me plan a comprehensive solution for the LocationSearch component.

My implementation plan:

Create a LocationSearch component with search input and autocomplete dropdown
Set up a map component using a mapping library (I'll use Leaflet since it's lightweight and versatile)
Create data models for locations, landmarks, and bike rental places
Implement the search functionality with autocomplete
Add map markers and animations for highlighting search results
Make everything responsive and visually appealing
Let's structure our files:

src/components/LocationSearch/ (main component folder)
index.tsx (exports the main component)
LocationSearch.tsx (main component)
SearchInput.tsx (search input with autocomplete)
MapView.tsx (map display component)
MarkerTypes.tsx (different marker styles)
src/hooks/ (custom hooks)
useSearch.ts (search logic)
useMapInteractions.ts (map zoom, pan, etc.)
src/data/ (data management)
locations.ts (location data)
bikeRentals.ts (bike rental data)
landmarks.ts (landmark data)
src/types/ (TypeScript type definitions)
Location.ts (location types)
SearchResult.ts (search result types)
src/utils/ (utility functions)
distance.ts (calculate distances)
mapHelpers.ts (map-related utilities)
This structure should provide a clean separation of concerns and keep files under 300 lines as required.

Based on your requirements, I'll create an Amsterdam LocationSearch component that enables users to search for and explore locations, landmarks, and bike rentals throughout the city. This first version will provide essential search and map visualization functionality while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface.

Core Features:

Interactive map visualization of Amsterdam with location markers
Search functionality for landmarks, addresses, and bike rental locations
Autocomplete search with suggestions that update as users type
Automatic map focusing and zooming to searched locations
Highlighted markers for bike rentals near searched locations
Animated markers to draw attention to search results
Responsive design for all device sizes
Clean, intuitive user interface with clear visual hierarchy
Design Elements:

Color system featuring primary orange (#F97316), secondary blue (#3B82F6), with complementary success, warning, and error states
Clean, modern interface with subtle animations for marker interactions
Crisp typography with proper contrast against map backgrounds
Responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
Visually distinct markers for different location types (landmarks, bike rentals)
Smooth transitions for map movements and search results
