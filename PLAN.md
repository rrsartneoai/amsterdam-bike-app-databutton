## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Design
- Create wireframes for the map interface and search bar.
- Mock up the dropdown UI for autocomplete suggestions.
- Design marker styles for bike rental locations and the center marker.

### Step 2: Backend Development
- Set up an API to fetch:
  - Amsterdam landmarks and attractions.
  - Address data.
  - Bike rental locations with details (e.g., name, district).
- Implement an algorithm to find nearby bike rentals for a given location.

### Step 3: Frontend Development
- Build the LocationSearch component with:
  - A search input field.
  - Autocomplete dropdown.
  - Integration with the map UI.
- Add functionality to highlight and animate markers on the map.
- Implement auto-focus behavior for the map.

### Step 4: Map Integration
- Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or Google Maps).
- Add support for:
  - Displaying landmarks, addresses, and bike rentals.
  - Center markers and animated markers.
- Implement interactive behaviors:
  - Clicking a search result zooms into the location.
  - Hovering over a marker shows additional details.

### Step 5: Testing
- Unit tests for the search functionality.
- Integration tests for the map and marker animations.
- User acceptance testing for the overall experience.

### Step 6: Deployment
- Deploy the application on a staging environment for further validation.
- Launch the application in production.
